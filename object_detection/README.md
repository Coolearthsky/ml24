# Object Detection

This example follows the
[current object detection tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/docs/vision/object_detection.ipynb),
using RetinaNet.

To run it:

* __sh setup.sh__ to install tensorflow models, and download and prepare the training
* __python3 train.py__ to run the trainer.  This will turn your CPU into a space heater for quite awhile.
* __python3 eval.py__ to run inference and look at the results
